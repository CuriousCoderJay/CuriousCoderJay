- 👋 Hi, I’m Jamison, AKA @CuriousCoderJay
- 👀 I’m interested in pursuing full-stack development, currently starting with front-end. I've been on a self-teaching journey since July 2023, learning from various courses, tutorials, and resources, but my goal is to gather enough skills to become a full-stack developer, and I'm also open to discovering which programming languages pique my interest along the way. 
- 🌱  I kicked things off with HTML/CSS, and I'm currently diving into GitHub to document my coding along the way and will be learning JavaScript the rest of this year. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that align with my current skills, as I'm eager to learn and grow. My primary goal is to acquire the skills necessary to enter the job market, and I'm open to working with individuals who can guide me along the way.
